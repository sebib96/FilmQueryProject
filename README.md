# Film Query App

## Description
*The Film Query App* allows users to retrieve and display film data. Based on the *Sakila Sample Database Schema 1.0*, the program allows users to view film and actor data based on Film ID, Actor ID, and/or a key word.

The program initially prompts the user for a Film ID to which it will display the Film that matches the ID input by the user. The second option is to search by a keyword, the result will be a film that contains the key word either in the Title or Description of said film.

Each Film result will always display the Film ID, Title, Description, Release Year, Rating, Features, Language, and Cast.

The program will continue to prompt the user for input until the user quits the program.

# Lessons Learned
First time experimenting with ORM. After trial and error I was finally able to understand the purpose and use of much of the boiler plate code such as initiating a connection in each method and initializing drivers. This project was a breakthrough for me as it finally connected *many* of the missing dots when I would visualize future projects of my own.
